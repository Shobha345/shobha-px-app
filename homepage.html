            <p>The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) 
                that doesn't distract from the layout. A practice not without controversy, 
                laying out pages with meaningless filler text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.
                As an alternative theory, (and because Latin scholars do this sort of thing) someone tracked down a 1914 Latin edition of De Finibus which challenges McClintock's 15th century claims and suggests that the dawn of lorem ipsum was as recent as the 20th century. The 1914 Loeb Classical Library Edition ran out of room on page 34 for the Latin phrase “dolorem ipsum” (sorrow in itself). 
                Thus, the truncated phrase leaves one page dangling with “do-”, while another begins with the now ubiquitous “lorem ipsum”.

                Until recently, the prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was born as a nonsense text. 
                “It's not Latin, though it looks like it, and it actually says nothing,” Before & After magazine answered a curious reader, 
                “Its ‘words’ loosely approximate the frequency with which letters occur in English, 
                which is why at a glance it looks pretty real.” As Cicero would put it, “Um, not so fast.”
                The placeholder text, beginning with the line “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit”, 
                looks like Latin because in its youth, centuries ago, it was Latin.
                Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College, 
                is credited with discovering the source behind the ubiquitous filler text. In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum, 
                his interest was piqued by consectetur—a genuine, albeit rare, Latin word. 
                Consulting a Latin dictionary led McClintock to a passage from De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”), 
                a first-century B.C. text from the Roman philosopher Cicero.
